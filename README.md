# Slant

Slant is a hacked client for Minecraft 1.8.9 built with closet modules and QoL features.
</div>

# Installation
Slant is standalone with dependents baked in and distributed as a `.jar` file. Just [download the latest release](https://github.com/jameesyy/slant/releases) and put it in your `./minecraft/mods/` folder.

# Features
- **Anti Bot**: detects and ignores spoofed players that are fabricated by anticheats.
- **Aimlock**: frame-by-frame aim correction by mapping normal camera rotations to alternate ones skewed toward the hitbox of the target entity.
- **Autoclicker**: Clicks the mouse for you when holding down the respective button.
- **Auto Ghead**: swaps your hotbar slot to a healing item and consumes it, when below a certain health threshold 
- **Auto Jump Reset**: jumps the moment you take damage and knockback from other players, substantially reducing received knockback.
- **Auto Tool**: swaps to the tool that mines the block you're trying to break the fastest.
- **Auto Weapon**: swaps to the leftmost slot with a weapon in your hotbar.


- **No Hit Delay**: removes the vanilla attack cooldown that occurs when you miss a certain threshold of left clicks in a short period of time.

- **No Jump Delay**: removes the vanilla jump cooldown that occurs when holding the jump key.

- **No Mining Delay**: removes the vanilla block-breaking cooldown that occurs between block break or damage ticks when holding down the left mouse button.

- **ESP**: renders hitboxes on players; particularly useful for invisibles and certain blocks.
  - **Shark ESP**: renders hitboxes for players below a certain health threshold.

- **Pointer**: renders a cursor at the aim position that provides the most reach on a target.

- **Safewalk**: dynamically toggles the sneak button for the player as they're bridging so they don't fall off a ledge or into the void.

All of the modules above are configurable to provide substantial advantages or subtle ones, whichever that best suits your use case.

# FAQ
### Why no [blatant feature here]?
Slant is not a blatant client. You won't see modules in the same vein as bhop, killaura/silentaura, or velocity (outside of a jump reset mode).
